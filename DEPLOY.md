   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

2. **Automatic Deployment**:
   - The workflow will automatically trigger on every push to the `main` branch
   - You can also manually trigger deployment from the Actions tab

## Configuration

- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist/`

## Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually:

```bash
npm run build
# Then upload the dist/ folder contents to your hosting service
```

- Check the Actions tab for deployment logs if issues occur
- Verify all assets are using relative paths (handled automatically by this config)
